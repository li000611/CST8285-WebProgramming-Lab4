		<h1 style="text-align:center;">Lab 4 - Instructions</h1>
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">CST8285</h2>
		<p>In this lab, you will be modifying some website files to add some CSS styling, as well as add a web form. Once the website files have been modified, you will upload them to your C:\xampp\htdocs , or where ever you installed your xampp software from lab 1.This allows you to use Apache server to test files on your laptop.<strong>Please read the entire lab before beginning.</strong></p>
		
		<h3>Step 1 - Download and Unzip the website files in temporary folder</h3>
		<p>There is a file called lab4.zip on BrightSpace under Week 4 - Course Documents - Lab 4. Download this file and extract it to a folder called <code>Lab_4</code> somewhere on your hard drive. This will be your project folder.</p>
		<h3>Step 2 - Review the file <code>Lab4.html</code></h3>
		<p>The file <code>Lab4.html</code> contains some tags that we have not covered in class. Please familiarize yourself with these tags. Specifically, find some information on:
		</p><ul>
			<li><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code></li>
			<li><code>&lt;legend&gt;</code></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Step 3 - Link your stylesheet to the Lab4.html file</h3>
		<p>There is a stylesheet called <code>style.css</code> in the <code>css</code> folder, in the project folder. Using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, link the stylesheet to the HTML page.</p>
		<h3>Step 4 - Change the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the web page</h3>
		<p>The format of the title should be Lab 4 by Firstname Lastname</p>
		<h3>Step 5 - Create the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element</h3>
		<p>Wrap all of the fieldset elements in a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element. The <code>method</code> of the form should be <code>post</code>, and the action should be <code>javascript:void(0);</code></p><p>
		</p><h3>Step 6 - Create the form elements</h3>
		<p>In each fieldset, there is a list of comments. Each comment will contain the name of a form field, and the type of form element for that field.</p>
		<p>Here is an example:	<code>&lt;!-- First Name | textbox, size of 40.--&gt;</code></p>
		<p>Create a two column table in <strong>each</strong> fieldset. For each comment in the fieldset, create a row in the table that has the name of the form field in the first column, and the form element in the second column. </p>
		<p>Each form element should have a name and an id at minimum. There may be other attributes required, which will be described in the comment <em>after</em> the form element type. </p>
		<p>For example, the above comment would look like this:<br>
		<code>&lt;tr&gt;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;First Name:&lt;/td&gt;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="firstName" id="firstName" size="40"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>
		&lt;/tr&gt;<br></code></p>
		<p>If, in the comment, a form field name has an asterisk (*) before the name, include it in the cell. Surround it with a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag, with a class of <code>required.</code>
		</p><h4>Notes on the <em>Personal Information</em> section</h4>
		<p>You will be required to create a dropdown box containing all the provinces. There should be an option for each province, and the value attribute of each option should be the province abbreviation. A list of provinces and their abbreviations is included in the comments.</p>
		<h4>Notes on the <em>Payment Information</em> section</h4>
		<p>The first form element is a group of radio buttons used to select a credit card type. There are three images in the <code>images</code> folder in the project folder. They are:
		</p><ul>
			<li>visa.png</li>
			<li>mastercard.png</li>
			<li>amex.png</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, display each icon beside its corresponding radio button. Your result should look like this: <img src="./Lab 4 Instructions_files/creditCardLayout.PNG" alt="Credit Card Layout" title="Credit card icon layout">
		</p><h4>Notes on the <em>Agree and Submit</em> section</h4>
		<p>The last row in the table does not contain a field name. Instead, place a submit button in one column, and a reset button in the other.</p>
		<h3>Step 7 - Add some style with CSS</h3>
		<p>There is a comment in the CSS stylesheet that contains instructions for defining styles to apply to your web page. Please create the rules as described in the CSS file.</p>
		<h3>Step 8 -  Test the files via Apache server in your laptop</h3>
		<p>Launch and Start the Apache server & upload your files into C:\xampp\htdocs. Then visualize them via a browser.Make sure the folder structures are correct and the various tags,styles are properly displayed & tested.</p>
		<p>Take screen-shots while visualizing the files on browser via http://localhost:7331/ ,or use your port number instead of 7331. Make sure to validate the code as well.</p>
		<h3>Step 9 - Zip the files, screen-shots, source code and upload your project to BrightSpace.</h3>
		

		<h3>Marking Scheme</h3>
		See the <em>Lab 4 Mark Breakdown</em> document for a break down.
        <p>Note that 30% of your final grade comes from the grades you obtained from your labs and assignments.</p>
